# Batch-Stuff
yeah just projects i made in batch nothing much.
:D

Discord: J.O.H.N#2595

1- J.O.H.N V1.4 (NO LONGER SUPPORTED) | First off, john is a scareware, not actual malware/virus/RAT, it's a small idea i got one day, and i turned it into reality.

Includes fake tracker.

Removal animation.

Whitelist system.

[Code for removal is 3301]

[Whitelist code is something you can figure out yourself ;)]


2- Key System, Alright its a lazy one indeed, but yes, it's just a small version of my original one, it has a dev mode, and it requires my
actual information to engage into it, so there's no way in hell im putting it here.

[Code to obtain key is the same as J.O.H.N V1.4 (3301)]




3- Animation V1.1 |

Characters:
Stickman: wave and say something.
Dragon: Spit dem flames, and blink its eye at you

4- Crypt0 l0ck3r | A more animated version of J.O.H.N

includes lock with skull (That fades away)

Another removal, which i renamed dismantle.


Disclaimer for dummies: Not an actual virus, or cypto currency ransomware, just a representation.



New update!
Crypt0 Lock3r has now become a official project, therefore i updated it, and now whenever you put the wrong key, a skull appears

Which is animated and says "You've been Crypt0 Lock3d"

Also it's eyes glow at the end

Enjoy!
