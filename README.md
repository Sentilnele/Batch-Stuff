# Batch-Stuff
yeah just projects i made in batch nothing much.
:D

Discord: J.O.H.N#2595

1- J.O.H.N V1.4 (NO LONGER SUPPORTED) | First off, john is a scareware, not actual malware/virus/RAT, it's a small idea i got one day, and i turned it into reality.

Includes fake tracker.

Removal animation.

Whitelist system.

[Code for removal is 3301]

[Whitelist code is something you can figure out yourself ;)]


2- Key System, Alright its a lazy one indeed, but yes, it's just a small version of my original one, it has a dev mode, and it requires my
actual information to engage into it, so there's no way in hell im putting it here.

[Code to obtain key is the same as J.O.H.N V1.4 (3301)]




3- Animation V1.0 |

Features:

Stickman that you can make say things

And wave animation, more to come!

I'm back, instead of updating animation i made a new fake virus, i introduce:

Crypt0 l0ck3r | A more animated version of J.O.H.N

includes lock with skull (That fades away)

Another removal, which i renamed dismantle.

And some uhh cool things n stuff, yeah sorry, i know i kinda made this as a excuse to not update animation, but i swear i will!

i wont leave this hanging like half life 3's release.
