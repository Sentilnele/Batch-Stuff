# Batch-Stuff
yeah just projects i made in batch nothing much.
:D

1- J.O.H.N V1.4 First off, john is a scareware, not actual malware, it's a small idea i got one day, and i turned it into reality.
Includes fake tracker.

Removal animation.

Whitelist system.

[Code for removal is 3301]

[Whitelist code is something you can figure out yourself ;)]


2- Key System, Alright its a lazy one indeed, but yes, it's just a small version of my original one, it has a dev mode, and it requires my
actual information to engage into it, so there's no way in hell im putting it here.

[Code to obtain key is the same as J.O.H.N V1.4 (3301)]
